        <h2 class="w3-yellow">Overview. </h2>
        <p class="w3-left">I recently visited Uganda, a country neighbouring my home country Kenya. 
            While i was there , i noticed that, a few of the locals would approach me to ask if i could
            connect them with an employer in Kenya when they realized i was Kenyan. Many of them wanted to work
            domestic jobs like home security , nanny , house help etc.<br></p>

            <p>This reminded me of how back home in Kenya , a lot of people preffered Ugandans to work for them in their homes.
           Ugandan workers are often preffered over Kenyans by most working proffesionals. This has led to a kind of relationship 
           between kenya and Uganda. Unfortunately , many underage girls from Uganda cross over to the Kenyan border in search of
           greener pastures. The girls face many challenges and are forced to crump themselves into small, shared houses as they 
           look for work.</p> <br>

          <p> That is the basis by which i decided to develope a platform where Kenyans and Ugandans can connect safely. I call this 
           project "Ugandajobsinkenya". It is a simplified job board where job applications can be made without the need for registration. The 
           potential eployers get to see all the details of the applicants and can choose which contact method to reach out to them with.

        <h2 class="w3-yellow">Emphathising with Ugandan job seekers and Kenyan employers </h2>
        <p class="w3-left"> After talking to quite a number of people , both Kenyans and Ugandans,
            I come up with two main user personas who would 
            benefit from the creation of a targeted job board .Below is a diagram representing the 
            two types of personas for Uganda jobs in Kenya , the ugandan job seeker and the kenyan employer

    <h2 class="w3-yellow">Creating emphathy maps for the two user personas.</h2>
    <p class="w3-left">
        After creating the two user personas , i moved on to making user maps
        for them based on the personas. I broke down what the two personas might
        think , say , do or feel regarding job seeking and seeking for employees 
        respectively.

    <h2 class="w3-yellow">Brainstorming ideas</h2>
    <p class="w3-left">
        This was a solo UX/UI project and so i sat down to brainstorm on a few ideas
        for the website . The idea was simple enough , come up with a niche website
        where domestic workers could come look for employment .

    <p class="w3-left">
        After the brainstorm session , i knocked down a few of the ideas i had come up
        with . I decided on the features i wanted to include in the design and it was 
        now time to come up with a site map.

<h2 class="w3-yellow">The site map</h2>
<p class="w3-left">
    I needed the site to have good information architecture and so i set out to create
    a well defined site architecture structure for a smooth experience by the users and
    also for better search engine optimisation.

<h2 class="w3-yellow">Journey maps</h2>
<p class="w3-left">
    Then, i went on to create two separate journey maps for the two main types of users, illustrating the 
    various pathways they may use if they were using the platform.

    <h2 class="w3-yellow">Flow charts</h2>
    <p class="w3-left">
        It was now time to come up with various flow charts. These were done to ensure that the users would have a seamless
        experience on the platform, from sign up to search and anything in between.

        <h2 class="w3-yellow">The wireframes</h2>
        <p class="w3-left">
            After i was finished with the flow charts , i went on to create wireframe designs of the platform using figma, with all 
            the required component designs. The first designs were in greyscale and then i went on and added a bit of color.
            I decided to present the designs via pdf formats.

            <h2 class="w3-yellow">Prototyping.</h2>
            <p class="w3-left">
               It was now time to do some prototyping in order to show the navigation paths. I used HTML5 and a combination of css and w3css
               to make this possible. I hosted the folder on netlify and have shared the link to the working prototype below
